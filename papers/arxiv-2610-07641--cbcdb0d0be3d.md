###### Abstract

Tool-augmented speech assistants typically serialize automatic speech
recognition, large language model inference, and external tool
execution. As a result, tool latency is incurred only after the user has
finished speaking and the LLM has identified the required tool calls. We
present speculative tool execution for on-device cascaded voice agents,
which predicts tool requests from partial ASR hypotheses and initiates
tool execution while speech is still being received, thereby reducing
end-to-end response latency. Our approach introduces a Predictor module
that anticipates tool calls during speech recognition, executes them
speculatively, and caches the results. The cached outputs are then
injected into the LLM prompt, enabling faster responses. Additionally,
to mitigate errors caused by user self-corrections during speech, we
employ a rule-based validation mechanism that selectively injects only
valid cached results. As a final safeguard, the LLM retains the ability
to issue tool calls directly, ensuring that the latency of our framework
is upper-bounded by the baseline serial execution pipeline in the worst
case. We evaluate our method using live measurements from a fully
implemented Android voice assistant. Our approach reduces the median
time-to-first-audio from 5.79 s to 4.60 s and decreases the standard
deviation from 3.49 s to 2.81 s, resulting in more predictable response
latency.

## 1 Introduction

Cascaded speech assistants connect automatic speech recognition (ASR), a
large language model (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS) in
sequence \[[10](#bib.bib13), [15](#bib.bib14)\], allowing explicit text
editing between modules and thus providing greater reliability than
end-to-end systems. These assistants can invoke tools for a wide range
of tasks, from adding calendar events to searching the
web \[[18](#bib.bib19), [16](#bib.bib20), [11](#bib.bib21),
[21](#bib.bib17), [22](#bib.bib18)\]. Unlike end-to-end speech systems
that can initiate tool calls during streaming
generation \[[1](#bib.bib8)\], conventional cascaded assistants must
wait for the user to finish speaking, finalize the transcript, and
obtain a tool request from the LLM before invoking external tools. While
the latency of simple local tools may be negligible, remote operations
such as time-consuming web search and can introduce substantial delays
that are directly perceived by users. Reducing this latency is therefore
important for responsive voice interactions on mobile
devices \[[13](#bib.bib22), [6](#bib.bib23)\].

Streaming speech provides an opportunity to reduce this delay because
user intent can often become apparent before the utterance is
complete \[[10](#bib.bib13), [9](#bib.bib12)\]. For example, when a
request can be predicted from a partial transcript, its execution can
begin while the user is still speaking, overlapping tool latency with
the remaining ASR time. This perspective treats streaming speech not
only as an input modality but also as an opportunity for anticipatory
computation \[[23](#bib.bib15), [3](#bib.bib16), [17](#bib.bib11)\].

Figure 1: Timing block diagram of speculative tool calling. Unlike the
cascaded baseline, our method hides part or all of the tool-calling
latency during ASR. The figure illustrates a case where one of two
required tool calls results in a cache hit.

Based on this observation, we introduce a rule-based predictor that
continuously observes partial ASR words, predicts likely long-latency
tool requests, and launches them before the LLM explicitly requests the
corresponding tools. The resulting outputs are stored in a speculative
result cache and can later be reused by the LLM execution
pipeline \[[1](#bib.bib8), [2](#bib.bib9), [14](#bib.bib10)\]. We then
inject the retrieved result directly into the LLM prompt before response
generation, allowing the model to use information obtained while the
user is still speaking. The LLM retains its standard tool-calling path
as a fallback when no suitable speculative result is available.

Figure 2: Overview of our methodology. During streaming ASR processing,
the Predictor anticipates potential tool calls and retrieves relevant
information via a Search API. The retrieved results are stored in the
Speculative Results Cache and directly injected into the LLM through
path (b). When the LLM later issues the corresponding tool call, the
system first checks the cached results through path (c) for
verification. As a fallback, the standard tool-calling workflow is
executed through path (a), corresponding to the conventional LLM tool
invocation process. In our setup, the ASR model runs on the CPU, while
the W4A16 quantized LLM runs on the NPU.

We evaluated our method in an on-device to analyze its performance under
resource-constrained conditions. The median waiting time from the end of
the user’s speech to the system’s response decreased from 5.79 seconds
to 4.60 seconds. In particular, fewer high-latency outliers led to
reduced variance and more predictable response times, while the
tool-calling F1 score increased from 44.8% to 60.6%. The ablation study
shows that direct cache injection is the main source of the latency
improvement but also accuracy, while verified fallback increases cache
reuse and reduces wasted speculative calls. The system remains robust to
hard-negative and adversarial requests, and the neural predictor
analysis suggests that the lightweight rule-based predictor provides a
practical balance between early prediction and on-device inference cost.

## 2 Methodology

We first formulate the problem and define the relevant timestamps. We
then describe the proposed algorithm, including the execution timing of
each component.

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Based on
Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")
baseline, we define the timestamp first. Let $`t_{0}`$ denote the start
time of the user’s utterance. Let $`t_{\mathrm{ASR}}`$ be the time at
which the ASR system finalizes the transcript. After transcript
finalization, the first LLM inference determines whether a tool should
be invoked and, if so, which tool to call. We denote the completion time
of this stage as $`t_{\mathrm{LLM\text{-}call}}`$. The selected tool is
then executed, and its completion time is denoted by
$`t_{\mathrm{Tool}}`$. Subsequently, a second LLM inference generates
the textual response to be provided to the user, whose completion time
is denoted by $`t_{\mathrm{LLM\text{-}resp}}`$ which means LLM response.
Finally, the generated response is passed to the text-to-speech (TTS)
system, and $`t_{\mathrm{TTS}}`$ denotes the completion time of speech
synthesis. The timeline can therefore be expressed as
$`t_{0}<t_{\mathrm{ASR}}<t_{\text{LLMcall}}<t_{\mathrm{Tool}}<t_{\text{LLMresp}}<t_{\mathrm{TTS}}=t_{\text{End}}.`$
We will hide time $`t_{\mathrm{Tool}}-t_{\text{ASR}}`$ with ongoing ASR
processing, thereby reducing the total time $`t_{\mathrm{TTS}}-t_{0}`$.

### 2.2 Predicting Which Tool to Call

To determine which tool to call while ASR is operating, we introduce a
predictor module which checks each partial ASR hypothesis during
streaming. It runs after a minimum number of words $`N_{\min}`$ is
observed, after every $`\Delta N`$ additional words, or when a utterance
ended pause longer than $`\tau_{\mathrm{pause}}`$ is detected. Based on
the real case distribution, we use $`N_{\min}=6`$, $`\Delta N=5`$, and
$`\tau_{\mathrm{pause}}=300`$ ms.

The predictor first divides the current partial ASR hypothesis into
non-overlapping clauses. The accumulated partial hypothesis available at
each prediction step is segmented using sentence-boundary punctuation
and coordinating expressions such as _and_, _but_, _also_, _then_, and
_while_. Each resulting clause is examined independently. As the ASR
hypothesis grows, the predictor repeats this procedure at the predefined
trigger points. For example, the partial hypothesis “Check the weather
in Boston, then find nearby restaurants, and tell me the yen exchange
rate” is divided into three clauses: “Check the weather in Boston,”
“find nearby restaurants,” and “tell me the yen exchange rate.” These
clauses may produce the candidate tuples (searchWeb, weather, “weather
in Boston”), (searchWeb, place, “nearby restaurants”), and (searchWeb,
exchange, “JPY–USD exchange rate”), respectively. The topic field is
drawn from a fixed set of 12 coarse-grained information-seeking
categories. Thus, the clause-level analysis allows multiple independent
information-seeking intents in a single utterance to be dispatched in
parallel. Our Prdictor is motivated by the idea of incremental
spoken-language understanding \[[12](#bib.bib3)\].

### 2.3 Direct Injection and Cache Matching

At $`t_{\mathrm{ASR}}`$, the finalized transcript and completed
speculative results are directly inserted into the LLM prompt before
decoding begins, as shown in
Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")(b).
The LLM first generates an output $`y`$ conditioned on both the
transcript and the cached results. Nevertheless, in our evaluation set,
the LLM still issued tool calls in 13% of cases, and due to the
limitations of the small quantized language model, 7% of cases
redundantly requested tools for information that had already been
provided. If the LLM nevertheless issues a tool call, the system checks
whether a matching result is already available in the speculative cache
at time $`t_{\text{verify}}`$ in
Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution"),
thereby preventing redundant retrieval requests, as shown in
Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")(c).
When a matching entry exists, the cached result is reused and returned
to the LLM. Otherwise, the requested tool is executed through the normal
path, as in
Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")(a).
This design enables the immediate use of results obtained during the
user’s speech while retaining LLM-directed tool calling and normal tool
execution as reliable fallback paths. An ablation study was conducted to
evaluate the contributions of direct injection and cache-verification
fallback.

| System             | p50   | p99   | FT p99 | Mean $`\pm`$ Std  | F1   |

## 3 Experiments

### 3.1 Experimental Setup

We evaluate on a Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (SM-S948N, Snapdragon Elite
Gen 5) with the hardware organization. Model inference uses a streaming
Conformer ASR model \[[9](#bib.bib12)\] and a TTS
model \[[20](#bib.bib1)\] running on the CPU, while a quantized
Llama-3.2-3B QAIRT LLM bundle \[[8](#bib.bib6), [19](#bib.bib7)\] is
executed through the Qualcomm QNN stack on the NPU. CPU-side components
handle audio I/O, the rule-based speculative predictor, cache
management, and HTTP dispatch to the EXA remote web-search
API \[[4](#bib.bib2)\].

### 3.2 Evaluation Dataset

There is no public dataset designed to evaluate tool use in an Android
voice assistant with tasks such as web search including android calendar
events, and alarms. We therefore construct an evaluation set that covers
these tasks and includes both normal requests and challenging cases. The
dataset contains 100 manually written English utterances covering
single- and multi-search requests, calendar and alarm requests, and also
requests that require no tool. Each utterance is annotated with the
expected tools and arguments. We additionally include 22 hard-negative
examples that contain search-related expressions but do not require a
search, and 24 adversarial examples that include corrections,
retractions, late intents, or topic changes. This gives a total of 146
evaluation samples. For reproducible evaluation, we synthesize each
utterance using Gemini-2.5-Flash-Preview-TTS \[[7](#bib.bib5)\] and
stream the generated audio into the device in real time. The full
evaluation dataset contains approximately 1.5 hours of audio, therefore
a complete run takes approximately 3 hours including TTS generation and
live network calls.

### 3.3 Metrics

Our primary latency metric is time-to-first-audio (TTFA). We measure
TTFA from the end of the input speech to the first TTS audio output. We
evaluate search performance separately from general tool planning. A
read request is counted as successful when the required searchWeb tool
result is used in the final answer. We report precision, recall, F1, and
exact accuracy for tool requests. False read measures the fraction of
turns that do not require a search tool but still use a search result.
Wasted calls are speculative tool calls that results are not required to
make a response. Cache-ready rate measures the fraction of required tool
calls for which a matching speculative result is already available
before the tool result is needed.

| Variant                              | p50   | p95   | Mean $`\pm`$ Std  | F1   | Ready | Wasted |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----------------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
|                                      | \(s\) | \(s\) | \(s\)             | (%)  | (%)   | calls  |
| cascaded                             | 5.79  | 11.92 | 6.69 $`\pm`$ 3.49 | 44.8 | 0.0   | 0      |
| speculative prefetch only            | 6.03  | 11.19 | 6.42 $`\pm`$ 2.69 | 44.8 | 0.0   | 47     |
| verified fallback                    | 6.05  | 11.35 | 6.53 $`\pm`$ 2.97 | 43.5 | 10.2  | 38     |
| direct cache injection               | 5.72  | 11.05 | 6.17 $`\pm`$ 2.68 | 63.0 | 46.6  | 6      |
| direct injection + verified fallback | 4.60  | 11.39 | 5.99 $`\pm`$ 2.81 | 60.6 | 47.7  | 5      |

Table 2: Ablation study. Components are added incrementally to the
cascaded baseline. Ready measures cache availability when a search
result is needed, and Wasted counts speculative tool calls whose outputs
are never consumed.

## 4 Results

### 4.1 Main Results

Table [1](#S2.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 2.3 Direct Injection and Cache Matching ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")
shows that our speculative system achieves faster and more consistent
response times than the cascaded baseline. Its primary advantage comes
from overlapping remote tool execution with the user’s speech, thereby
hiding a substantial portion of the search latency. For example, for a
15-second user query requiring approximately 10 seconds of search-tool
execution, our method reduced the time to first audio (TTFA) from 17
seconds to 8 seconds. By mitigating such latency outliers in p99,
speculative execution improves both the responsiveness and the perceived
reliability of the voice agent.

Our method also improves tool-selection accuracy, leading to a higher F1
score and fewer unnecessary speculative tool calls. We hypothesize that
this improvement arises from providing the small 3B language model with
additional task-relevant context during tool selection. This observation
is consistent with prior work showing that smaller language models can
benefit substantially from informative prompts and in-context
examples \[[5](#bib.bib4)\]. Thus, the proposed system improves not only
the timing of tool execution but also the efficiency and accuracy with
which tools are selected.

Speculative execution also makes response timing less sensitive. In the
cascaded baseline, remote tool calls begin only after ASR and LLM-based
tool selection have completed, causing end-to-end latency to depend
heavily on potentially unstable network delays. In contrast, our method
shifts a substantial portion of this variable latency into the user’s
speaking time. Consequently, the latency remaining after the user
finishes speaking is dominated by local model inference, which is
comparatively stable. This results in a faster and more predictable
interaction experience without increasing the final-answer failure rate.

| Set            | $`n`$ | p50   | F1   | False read | Spec calls | Wasted |
| -------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
|                |       | \(s\) | (%)  | (%)        |            | calls  |
| Hard negatives | 22    | 6.24  | N/A  | 9.1        | 2          | 2      |
| Adversarial    | 24    | 8.40  | 90.2 | 12.3       | 21         | 21     |

Table 3: Robustness diagnostics, with key outcomes in bold. N/A denotes
an inapplicable metric.

### 4.2 Ablation Study

Table [2](#S3.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 3.3 Metrics ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")
summarizes the contribution of each component. The “Speculative prefetch
only” variant runs speculative tool calls concurrently with on-device
ASR while retaining the remaining baseline pipeline. Although its median
latency increases slightly, its mean and p95 latency remain comparable
to or lower than those of the cascaded baseline. This suggests that
concurrent ASR and speculative prefetching introduce no noticeable
latency penalty.

The “Verified fallback” variant allows the system to consult the cache
only after the LLM has selected a tool. Its latency and F1 score remain
close to those of the baseline, indicating that cache reuse alone
provides limited benefit when the full tool-selection process still
occurs after ASR. We attribute this result to the fact that the LLM must
complete tool selection before the system can determine whether a
matching result is available, leaving most of the tool-selection latency
exposed and introducing an additional cache lookup.

Directly injecting prefetched results into the prompt provides a larger
improvement, reducing mean latency from 6.69 to 6.17 seconds and
increasing F1 score from 44.8% to 63.0%. We attribute this improvement
to the in-context learning effect discussed in
Section [4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Main Results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution").
Our final method adds a verified fallback to this design and achieves
the lowest median and mean latency, the highest Ready rate, and the
fewest wasted calls. Although its p95 latency and F1 are slightly worse
than those of direct cache injection alone, it provides the best overall
balance between response speed, cache utilization, and speculative-call
efficiency. These results indicate that direct cache injection is
primarily responsible for the improvement in tool-selection accuracy,
while verified fallback improves the effective reuse of speculative
results.

### 4.3 Hard Negatives and Adversarial Cases

Table [3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Main Results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")
evaluates robustness under two challenging conditions. Hard negatives
contain search-related keywords but do not actually require a search
action, whereas adversarial examples include user corrections,
retractions, and topic changes that alter the intended tool request
during speech. The system achieves a low false read rate of 9.1% on hard
negatives, indicating that it rarely triggers unnecessary searches based
on keywords alone. F1 score is not reported for this set because no
ground-truth search requests exist. On adversarial examples, the system
maintains a F1 score of 90.2% with a false read rate of 12.3%, showing
that speculative results are usually discarded correctly when the user’s
intent changes. The 21 wasted calls reflect the additional network cost
of speculative execution, but because speculation is restricted to
read-only tools, such errors do not revise alarms, calendars, or other
user data.

fraction of transcript words observed before the first prediction. Bold
is the best value per column.

### 4.4 Can an LLM based Predictor Perform Better?

Table [4](#S4.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 4.3 Hard Negatives and Adversarial Cases ‣ 4 Results ‣ Hiding Tool Latency in On-Device Cascaded Voice Agentthrough Speculative Execution")
shows that a neural predictor can provide substantially higher routing
accuracy than the proposed rule-based predictor. However, these results
are obtained from an offline experiment using the on-device LLM as the
same in experiments and do not account for its inference latency. In
practical deployment, the LLM predictor should complete tool-routing
decisions while the user is still speaking in order to create an overlap
window for speculative execution. Given the runtime cost of on-device
LLM inference, it is unlikely that the prediction can consistently
finish before ASR finalization, which limits the opportunity for hiding
tool latency. Running the LLM predictor earlier provides only a modest
advantage over the lightweight rule-based predictor while introducing
additional competition for on-device NPU resources. Therefore, our
design favors a simple rule-based predictor, while delegating final
semantic verification to the main LLM.

## 5 Conclusion

We presented a speculative tool execution method for an on-device voice
agent that starts tool calls during streaming ASR. On a commercial
Android device, our method reduced the latency and improved F1 accuracy.
The results show that direct cache injection is the main source of the
accuracy improvement, while verified fallback increases cache reuse and
reduces wasted calls. Overall, our method makes voice-agent responses
faster, more accurate, and more stable.
